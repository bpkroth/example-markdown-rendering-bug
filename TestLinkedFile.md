# Test Linked File

Here's another file that's not the main [`README.md`](./README.md) file.

Note that, it get's resolved to a `tree/branch-name/path/to/file` style URL, which then works for other files as well since then they're already relative to one another.

> And that works even inside a "note" block like this: [`README.md`](./README.md)
